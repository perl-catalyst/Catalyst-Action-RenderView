NAME
    Catalyst::Action::RenderView - Sensible default end action.

SYNOPSIS
        sub end : ActionClass('RenderView') {}

DESCRIPTION
    This action implements a sensible default end action, which will forward
    to the first available view, unless status is set to 3xx, or there is a
    response body. It also allows you to pass "dump_info=1" to the url in
    order to force a debug screen, while in debug mode.

    If you have more than one view, you can specify which one to use with
    the "default_view" config setting (see Catalyst's "$c-"view($name)>
    method).

METHODS
  end
    The default "end" action. You can override this as required in your
    application class; normal inheritance applies.

INTERNAL METHODS
  execute
    Dispatches control to superclasses, then forwards to the default View.

    See "METHODS/action" in Catalyst::Action.

EXTENDING
    To add something to an "end" action that is called before rendering,
    simply place it in the "end" method:

        sub end : ActionClass('RenderView') {
          my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
          # do stuff here; the RenderView action is called afterwards
        }

    To add things to an "end" action that are called *after* rendering, you
    can set it up like this:

        sub render : ActionClass('RenderView') { }

        sub end : Private { 
          my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
          $c->forward('render');
          # do stuff here
        }
